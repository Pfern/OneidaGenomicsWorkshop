# Target audience: #
Researchers with a strong interest in high throughput sequence data analysis in the context of microbial pathogens, that have a present or upcoming data analysis problem in their hands.
 
# Pre-requisites: #
The Linux environment will be used in all the sessions. 
<br>Familiarity with Linux basics is required, at the level of basic command structure, file system navigation, redirection, piping, etc.
<br>Entry level bioinformatics knowledge will be very handy, not really required-

# Workshop Objectives: #
The main objectives of the workshop are:
<br>- to provide a hands-on tutorial on the software that is being developed and already in use in the scope of ONEIDA.
<br>- to provide an update on current plans in software development for ONEIDA 

# Bring your own data (BOD) policy: #
Participants will be using datasets that have been prepared for demonstration purposes
<br>Participants will be allowed to bring their data sets, and test the different analytical pipelines.
<br>Interesting results will be discussed amongst the workshop participants.
